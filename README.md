# AIDA course on Uncertainty Estimation in Machine Learning, 2024
Lab material/code for the AIDA Uncertainty Estimation in Machine Learning Course @ ESSAI 2023.

### Local setup

These notebooks were designed and tested on Google Colab.
We advise to use Colab to run them during the lectures as it will greatly speed up the setup process, since (almost) all of the required libraries are already pre-installed there.

If you want to run the code locally, create a Python environment (we used Python 3.10 locally) and install the requirements using pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
